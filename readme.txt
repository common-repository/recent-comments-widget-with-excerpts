I fixed a bug that prevented the options from functioning properly. This problem was pointed out on my blog by Elaine. Thank you, Elaine.

I introduced fixes and updates that have been provided by the users of this plugin. These fixes work better with unicode/world wide character sets, other plugins that affect comment output and comments that contain HTML tags. Thank you Mike C, Pointbre and Eduardo for your help.

This version includes a new option to include or exclude comments made by the admin user. This feature was requested by Christine C.

= 0.110221 =
The length of comment excerpts can now be changed in the widget options. To achieve this additonal option, I had to alter the widget name. This means updating to this new version of the plugin will remove and require you to add the widget to your widget area again. There is simply no way for me to add functionality without causing this incovenience.
